After some review of the project, I just wanna clarify a couple of things and give you guys some more specific tasks with the script:
 
Goal:
Create a script that runs from a USB( All file locations will be uploaded to the USB), that will stage a windows laptop depending on the location. For example, if it is a Las Vegas computer, it will install the Las Vegas automate. It will also install specific things based upon whether it is an office or a warehouse laptop. 
 
 
Assigned Tasks:
 
Tanner-
Writing the Office installation package
Writing the if, else statements to determine laptop locations and laptop type
 
Abigail-
Upload the install files to the USB and create folders
Writing the warehouse installation package
Writing the install locations from the USB for all locations ( Writing the file paths)
 
Tips and tricks:
 
The script should be pulling from the USB, if it tries to pull from our server without being on the domain it will be blocked due to network security.
 
Don't worry about having it set the name for now, we would like this to be able to pull the install folders from a local location.
 
Required items:
 
Installs- Chrome, Sophos, Labtech, Drata, Adobe reader
 
Office installs- Office, Cato
 
Warehouse Installs- Libreoffice
 
Program locations: Powershell ISE
 
Collaboration, of course
